<h1 align="center">CALCULATOR</h1>



I have created a basic calculator application using the C# programming language, which incorporates a graphical user interface (GUI) and is capable of performing fundamental mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator's interface allows users to input numerical values and select the desired operation through an intuitive visual representation. Upon executing the calculation, the application processes the inputs and displays the corresponding result on the GUI. This calculator provides a user-friendly and efficient means of performing elementary calculations within a visually appealing environment.
